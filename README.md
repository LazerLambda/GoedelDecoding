Simple Haskell module for Gödel decoding. The function ```getfromgoedelnumber``` decodes Gödel numbers 
where the index of the character is in the range of 1 to 26. Such that:

  p_1 ^ <index of the character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"> * p_2 ^ <index of the character in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"> ...
  
This code was created to solve an uni exercise.
